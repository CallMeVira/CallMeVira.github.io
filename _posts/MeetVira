### Meet Vira The Queen of Chaos (and Curiosity)

Vira is curious, but so, so overwhelmed.

She feels the urgent need to do everything all at once—grow in her career, change paths, learn new skills, switch tracks, change the world, and somehow do it all right now.
She lives in a tornado of ambition—spinning two steps to the right, three steps to the left, one step forward, and...wait, has it been a year already?! Unsure whether she’s making progress or just caught in perpetual motion.

Call me Vira. 

I’m still figuring out who Vira is. She’s certainly evolving, but I’m learning that evolution can be messy, and life apparently doesn’t have one correct solution (Okay, why didn’t someone tell me? Or was I not listening?).

So here I am, stuck between all the lives I wish I could live but paralyzed because my brain, naturally, is keeping score. The list of everything I want to do is...um, long.

Some days, I dream of being a marine biologist, solely to befriend whales—because, honestly, what’s more magical than that? Other days, I want to be a pilot or a potter. Most often, when I’m not being completely unhinged, you’ll find this cast of characters vying for the spotlight in my mind:


	- Product Manager
	- Stay the course: Technical Architect/Lead 
	- AI Fairness and policy Advocate
	- Runner of programs at NGO 
	- Developmental Economist
	- Work in the UN!?! 

 
I want to be everything, all at once. But I’m confronted with annoying realities like mortality and finite time. Avoiding decisions, I’ve realized, is often the most expensive choice—it costs me time, energy, and the chance to grow in any direction. I'm caught in the chaos—stuck, frustrated, and aching to break free. After my most recent spiral, I realized something had to change. 

That’s when I hear my father’s voice, quoting the Bhagavad Gita: “Do your duty without worrying about the results.” His words remind me to focus on what I can control—taking one step at a time, without obsessing over the finish line.

Don't tell him, but I think he has a point. Maybe this is the approach I need for life—mainly because, honestly, I have no clue what the outcome should be. Instead of scattering my energy in every direction, I’ve decided to pause, breathe, and focus on one thing at a time.

### The Quest: Learning to just, well learn.

The lack of curiosity is clearly not my problem—it’s reigning in said curiosity before I try to solve AI ethics while befriending whales. Through this blog, I’m solving for consistency. I’m diving into this grind with full force—mind, body, and soul—but this time, with intention. Instead of just dreaming, I’m committing to learning and doing.

For the first month, my focus is on improving my current status quo:
	• Working on my mental health
	• Boosting my work competence with system design content
	• Prioritizing self-care
	
So if you’re up for a bit of chaos, curiosity, and growth, let’s take this adventure together. One step, one lesson, one discovery at a time.

Vira and I are just getting started.
